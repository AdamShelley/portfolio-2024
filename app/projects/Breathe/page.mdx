# Breathe - Raycast Extension


I have loved using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) for the past year or so, and wanted to experiement with their API to create a simple extension that would benefit me day-to-day.
I think it's healthy to sometimes have a few seconds or minutes not necessarily doing anything, but just taking your hands off the keyboard, having a stretch or even just breathing.
*This is still a work in progress.*

## Features

### Quick Meditation Sessions

Currently you can choose from a 10 second 'mindful moment' or an unlimited Box Breathing sessionStorage.

### Stats

Even though its not a competition. You can see how many sessions you have completed.

### Usage

-  Start a session directly from the Raycast command bar.
-  Easily configure reminders and session settings from the extension's preferences.
-  I personally use the Hyper Key (from [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)) so I can map the extension to **Caps Lock + B**.

### Download
I am still actively working on this extension. Until it is submitted to Raycast Extension store, you can clone the repo at my Github below.
