# Guessagram


With the success of Wordle, many have tried making their own small addictive game. This is my version. 

I used **NextJS** to handle the frontend and **Tailwind** for the styling. I used **Prisma** to link to a postgres database hosted on Railway. The database is automatically reset daily using a cron job.
