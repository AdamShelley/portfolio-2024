# LangAI



## Background
 I wanted to create an app that could help me learn a language
(specifically Mandarin). One of the major difficulties I found with the
learning process was finding enough content at my proficiency level to
practice reading with. This is my solution to that problem.

## Goals
<ul>
 <li>
   ### Story Creation: 
    <p>
      Designed to craft engaging stories tailored to different profiency
      levels and with different genres.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   ### AI Integration: 
    <p>
      It should utilize AI to generate the stories and the cover pictures
      for them.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   ### UX: 
    <p>It should feel easy and comfortable to use.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
   ### Cost Effective: 
    <p>
      Mindful of expenses related to AI APIs, utilizing Databases
      economically.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   ### Interactivity: 
    <p>
      Giving the users the ability to vote on which direction the story
      should go, adding an interactive story aspect.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   ### Multilingual Potential: 
    <p>
      Currently the focus is on Chinese but this app could be modified to
      include other languages too.
    </p>
  </li>
  </ul>
