# LangAI

## Background

I wanted to create an app that could help me learn a language (specifically Mandarin). One of the major difficulties I found with the learning process was finding enough content at my proficiency level to practice reading with. This is my solution to that problem.

## Goals

### Story Creation

Designed to craft engaging stories tailored to different proficiency levels and with different genres.

### AI Integration

It should utilize AI to generate the stories and the cover pictures for them.

### UX

It should feel easy and comfortable to use.

### Cost Effective

Mindful of expenses related to AI APIs, utilizing Databases economically.

### Interactivity

Giving the users the ability to vote on which direction the story should go, adding an interactive story aspect.

### Multilingual Potential

Currently, the focus is on Chinese but this app could be modified to include other languages too.

## Android Download

-  Stories and Pictures generated by AI.
-  Tap to translate unfamiliar words for instant English translations.
-  Stories can be filtered by genre and level for a tailored reading experience.
-  User-driven narratives, stories can be voted on by users for a more interactive experience. The next part of the story is then automatically generated.
