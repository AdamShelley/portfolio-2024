# React Onboarder Tool

Developed to offer an engaging introduction to new users across websites, this tool replaced the need for individual guides with a uniform, interactive experience.


### Learnings:

Creating this tool was a lesson in package development and distribution. It was my first experience publishing to NPM, and I learned a lot about the process of creating a package, documenting and versioning it in an understandable way.
