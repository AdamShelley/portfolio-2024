# Breathe - Raycast Extension


I have loved using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) for the past year or so, and wanted to experiement with their API to create a simple extension that would benefit me day-to-day.

I think it's healthy to have a few seconds or minutes not necessarily doing anything, but just taking your hands off the keyboard, having a stretch or even just breathing.
*This is still a work in progress.*

##  Challenge

The Raycast API is quite strict on the way to build components, you are limited to things like lists and markdown text. 
Making something appear dynamic or interactive is a bit of a challenge. You have to get a bit creative with the special characters and emojis.

## Features

### Quick Meditation Sessions

Currently you can choose from a 10 second 'mindful moment' or an unlimited Box Breathing.

### Stats

Even though its not a competition. You can see how many sessions you have completed.

### Usage

-  Start a session directly from the Raycast command bar.
-  I personally use the Hyper Key (from [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)) so I can map the extension to **Caps Lock + B**.

### Download
I am still actively working on this extension. Until it is submitted to Raycast Extension store, you can clone the repo at my Github below.

<MarkdownButtons github="https://github.com/AdamShelley/breathe"/>

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  const mdxContent = useMDXComponents()
  return <MdxLayout components={mdxContent}>
    {children}
    </MdxLayout>
}
