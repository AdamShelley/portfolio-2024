I'm subscribed to the emails that [John Crickett](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/) sends out for coding challenges and found the latest one rather intriguing, so I thought I would document my progress on actually building something.
This calls for building a **BitTorrent client**. 

As a Web Developer, there is so much I don't know - especially about Networking, Buffers, Bytes - and things that I don't have to think about in the day-to-day of doing my job (centering a div takes a lot of mental bandwidth, after all!)

Part 1 is about building something to Decode and Encode Bencode (pronounced Bee-encode) - Okay, this is the first time I've ever heard of Bencoding, let alone being able to parse it. But thats why I am doing this. I want to find gaps in my knowledge and try to improve.

Oh, I am also building this in TypeScript. Because that's what I know. And another rule I'm setting myself is not allowing AI to help me code, I will allow it to give hints for error messages, basically using it as a fancy search engine, and try to rely on my own critical thinking. 

> **Note: I don't know if the way I am doing this will be final and/or correct. This is a learning experience.**

Taken from the BitTorrent spec: [BitTorrent Spec](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html)

```# bencoding
- Strings are length-prefixed base ten followed by a colon and the string. For example 4:spam corresponds to 'spam'.
- Integers are represented by an 'i' followed by the number in base 10 followed by an 'e'. For example i3e corresponds to 3 and i-3e corresponds to -3. Integers have no size limitation. i-0e is invalid. All encodings with a leading zero, such as i03e, are invalid, other than i0e, which of course corresponds to 0.
- Lists are encoded as an 'l' followed by their elements (also bencoded) followed by an 'e'. For example l4:spam4:eggse corresponds to ['spam', 'eggs'].
- Dictionaries are encoded as a 'd' followed by a list of alternating keys and their corresponding values followed by an 'e'. For example, d3:cow3:moo4:spam4:eggse corresponds to {'cow': 'moo', 'spam': 'eggs'} and d4:spaml1:a1:bee corresponds to {'spam': ['a', 'b']}. Keys must be strings and appear in sorted order (sorted as raw strings, not alphanumerics).
```

I thought I would start simple and assume the provided values to my decoder will be strings (this will change to allow Buffers later).

**Step 1: Decoding** 

For the most part this was not too bad, just manipulated the string to get the value you expected. e.g. plug in "4:spam" and you should get "spam" back.

Lists/Dictionaries were trickier, but in the end its just plugging those values back into the decodeString or decodeNumber function and returning the object as shown above. 


**Step 2: Encoding**

This was even easier, e.g. given a string "spam", just return its length with a colon ":" -> 4:spam.
Encoding numbers are similar:

```ts
const encodeString = (value: string): string => {
	return `${value.length}:${value}`;
};

const encodeNumber = (value: number): string => {
	return `i${value}e`;
};
```


List and dictionaries could just follow the same pattern of calling the type they found:

```ts
const encodeArray = (value: Array<any>): string => {
	let finalstr = value.map((val) => encode(val)).join("");
	return `l${finalstr}e`;
};

  
const encodeObject = (value: { [key: string]: any }): string => {
	const keys = Object.keys(value).sort();
	let finalStr = keys.map((key) => {
		return encodeString(key) + encode(value[key]);
	}).join("");

	return `d${finalStr}e`;
};
```

**Step 3: Modify to handle Buffers**

After a bit of back and forth, I decided that to allow both strings and buffers in the decode function, 
I would just convert any String to buffer and then decode like that. 
This included modifying the checks to account for the charCodeAt instead of directly checking strings like 'i', 'l', 'd'.

```ts
  // Example of getting the char code
  buffer[start] === "i".charCodeAt(0)
```


**Step 4: Test on a real torrent file**

So I downloaded the .torrent file from LibreOffice to test out my new decoder, imported with a simple CLI script - and what happened? It didn't work...

It turns out I had missed a few edge cases, I mixed up some return indexes, I forgot to return in certain locations, but after a while, success!

I received this in the console :

```

  decodedValue: {

    ]
  },
  index: 23909
}

```

A beautiful mess.

The next step will be finding out what all this means and attempts to extract the relevant data from this *.torrent* file, create a **HTTP GET** request and retrieve the list of peers. 

That's what I will be looking forward to doing in Part 2
