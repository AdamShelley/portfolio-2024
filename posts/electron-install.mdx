I have been experimenting recently with ElectronJS, and have wanted a nice solution for the styling side. With my latest projects I have been implementing Tailwind and Shadcn with allows quick building of some nice, simple looking components.

Documentation is pretty thin on the ground when it comes to using Electron-vite with Tailwind and shadcn, so after failing to get it working a few times, I thought I would explain what *did* work for me eventually in the hope it will help someone else or even myself in future when i refer back to this post.

Firstly I used a vite based template: 
[Here](https://github.com/ldlac/vite-electron-builder)

This is a template I saw in the Electron docs and was suggested as a vite based template. I picked up the forked version which is modified for React instead of Vue.
Check it out, you can use another vite based template if you wish but I cannot promise the same result.

So without further ado, with your fresh new project. How do you go about getting Tailwind and shadcn to play nice with it?

Fork, clone and install to your file system.

Check it works as expected:

## The Tailwind Part

[Relevant Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

Firstly run the following two commands: 

```
bun add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

```
bunx tailwindcss init
```

You should now have a **tailwind.config.js** file in your project root. 

```
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */ 
module.exports = { 
	content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"], 
	theme: { 
		extend: {}, 
	}, 
	plugins: [], 
}
```

**However**, this will not work, the content array will be searching the wrong area, so this will need to modified with the following to scan the correct Electron folders: 

```
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */ 
module.exports = { 
	content:["./packages/renderer/index.html","./packages/renderer/src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"], 
	theme: { 
		extend: {}, 
	}, 
	plugins: [], 
}
```

Or make sure it is targeting the correct renderer folder if you have a different/modified template.

Also create a **postcss.config.js** file in the root of your project.
Add the following to the file:

```
module.exports = {
    plugins: {
      tailwindcss: {},
      autoprefixer: {},
    }
  };
```

Next add the following to your main entry point CSS file. For me in this template, it is 

*App.css*
```
@tailwind base; 
@tailwind components; 
@tailwind utilities;
```

Tailwind should work as intended now. Test it out to see if it works.

## Adding Shadcn

This bit is slightly trickier, and depending on what you want to do you can take this in two direction. First decide if you intend to use the Shadcn CLI to install components or you want to copy/paste them manually.


With that in mind continue on.

WIP - I will update this post with the next steps soon.


{/* Install the following: 

```
bun add tailwindcss-animate class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge
```

```
bun add lucide-react
```




### Copy / Paste Version
Docs: [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/manual)




### CLI Version

You will then need to create tsconfig.json in the root project folder if you haven't already.

Copy the following code: 

*tsconfig.json*
```
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"baseUrl": ".",
		"paths": {
			"@od/shadcn-ui": ["libs/shadcn-ui/src/index.ts"],
			"@od/shadcn-ui/*": ["libs/shadcn-ui/src/*"]
		}
	}
}
```


Issues: 

Classname issue:

https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/issues/120
Turned off with 

````
 "react/prop-types": "off"
````




Oh but we are not done yet

**Issues to fix:**

errors when pushing to github: 

   Ã— eslint --cache --fix

 'className' is missing in props validation

Put this in eslintrc.json in renderer folder: 

`"react/prop-types": "off",` */}
