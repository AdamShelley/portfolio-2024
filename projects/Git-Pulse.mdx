# Git-Pulse
I wanted to make a minimal **Github** client in which I could list the issues I am working on, make comments, 
and plug in my own API key and have it summarise or export issues I've completed. 

Writing changelogs are something that gets forgotten about or ignored (**[Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)**), so I wanted to automate that part.

##  Challenge

This was my first time working with Tauri, which recently released version 2. Tauri uses Javascript or Typescript on the Frontend, and Rust on the backend.
I had never used Rust before, so it was a steep learning curve. 

This is where using AI can shine, since I know Javascript/Typescript I am able to use AI like Claude 
to help understand the different systems (like the way the types work & syntax), and problem-solve when the AI is not fully accurate.

## Features
- Minimal Github client
- Can list issues
- Can create, edit, and delete commnets
- You can add your own API Key and have it summarise an issue into a changelog using Anthropics AI **[Claude](https://claude.ai/)**.
- Download the summarised info to a .md file.
