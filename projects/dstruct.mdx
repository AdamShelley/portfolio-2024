# DStruct

<MarkdownButtons  demo="https://dstruct-alpha.vercel.app/" />
{/* github="https://github.com/AdamShelley/dstruct" */}

This is a project that allows users to upload a file, share a link with someone else, and then once the download has been accessed once - It will be deleted.

For example if you wanted to share an important file with a client, but don't want it stored online forever - This is the tool for you.

## Stack
- NextJS
- Neon - a postgres database
- Cloudflare (With AWS-SDK)

You can share a link or QR code with the person you want to share the file with. Once they have accessed the file, it will be deleted from the server.

There is a maximum of 24 hours for the file to be accessed, after that it will be deleted. (Other expiry times can be set).
