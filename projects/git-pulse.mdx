# Git-Pulse
Git-Pulse is a minimal **Github** client which was born out of my desire for a Github to list the issues I am working on, make comments, 
and plug in my own AI API key and have it summarise or export issues I've completed. And to learn more about desktop applications - of course!

##  Challenge

This was my first time working with Tauri, which recently released version 2. Tauri uses Javascript or Typescript on the Frontend, 
and Rust on the backend. Having never used Rust before, it was a steep learning curve. 

This is where using AI can shine, since I know Javascript/Typescript I am able to use AI like Claude 
to help understand the different systems (like the way the types work & syntax), and then problem-solve when the AI is not fully accurate.

## Features
- Minimal Github client
- Can list issues
- Can create, edit, and delete commnets
- You can add your own API Key and have it summarise an issue into a changelog using Anthropics AI **[Claude](https://claude.ai/)**.
- Download the summarised info to a .md file.
- Writing changelogs are something that gets forgotten about or ignored (**[Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)**), so I wanted to automate that part.
